# burgerTime
A full stack app about burgers.

# Opening the Page
If you want to serve the file locally, after you run `npm install` just run  `node server.js` and you can check out the app at your localhost address.

# App Basics
- The app's premise is that you've been diagnosed with chronic heart disease so to fill that gaping hole in your soul without another expensive bypass, you decide to use this app to simulate binging burgers. (Regurgitation included so you can eat it again.) We even let the user add new burgers to this horrid cycle.
- This was built with the intention of familiarizing myself with the MVC app structure, which by the way I think should be called the MCV instead.
